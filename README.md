# cmdebug

Nasty script I wrote to debug cable modem issues I was having with my NETGEAR CM1200 cable modem. 

### Note: Only tested with cm1200, the indexes used were specific for this modems firmware. The script may work with other firmware versions, but the correct indexes will need to be discovered in the DocsisStatus.htm.
